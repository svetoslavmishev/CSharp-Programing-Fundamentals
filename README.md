<center>## Course from the main program in SoftUni 2017/2018</center>

### 
The <b>”Programming Fundamentals”</b> course extends the previously gained basic coding skills from the ”Programming Basics” course at the Software University and adds additional knowledge and practical programming skills.

The course covers <b>source control systems</b>, <b>Git</b> and <b>GitHub</b> for team collaboration, understanding the basic <b>data types</b> in programming, extracting pieces of code into <b>methods</b> with parameters and return value, using the debugger to trace the program execution and find bugs, processing sequences of elements using <b>arrays</b> and <b>lists</b>, using collections, working with matrices for processing tabular data, working with <b>dictionaries</b> to map keys to values, using <b>strings</b> for text processing, and the basics of working with <b>classes</b> and <b>objects</b>, using API classes and defining simple classes.

Along with the programming techniques, the <b>algorithmic thinking</b> and <b>problem solving skills</b> are advanced by solving hundreds of practical programming problems. All exercises and exams are automatically evaluated with real-time feedback through the SoftUni online judge system. At the end all students take a <b>practical</b> programming exam</b>.
